## My Dotfiles

Recently I decided to move to Linux. This also gave me the oppurtunity to
rearrange my config and setup a little bit. One of my long time "wants" was to
move to Neovim. So as of now that's what I've been focussing on and what you
can find in this repo. As time continues I will be updating the repo with
other config files.
